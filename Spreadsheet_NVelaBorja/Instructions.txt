Welcome to VelaBorja's Spreadsheet application!

Features:
	1. Cell data entry (numerical only)
	2. Cell reference "=A24 + B21" 
	3. Cell color
	4. Cell undo/redo functionality
	5. Circular reference / Self reference detection

1. Simply click on a cell and type in number values!
2. To referenc another cell, simply type "=" into the cell followed by the cell you would like to reference.
	For example, if cell A1 has value "55", I could type "=A1" in cell B1, and cell B1 would become "55".
	Then, if you were to change A1's value to "44", cell B1 would also update to "44".
3. Select one or multiple cells, then click on "Cell" on the menu bar, then "Select Color". This will spawn
	a color selection menu. After selecting your color, click "OK" to see your changes take place. 
	Not satisfied with how it looks? Just undo!
4. Any change you make to the spreadsheet, regardless of how many cells were changed in a single step, can be undone.
	Simply go to Edit > Undo ______ , where ______ will say what your most recent change was.
	The same applies to Redo, and will only be available in the menu if you have made an Undo.
5. If you happen to make a self reference, the spreadsheet will fill the cell with "!Self Reference".
	For example, in cell A1, you cannot enter "=A1".
	Similarly, if you make a circular reference, such as A1:"=B1", B1:"=B2", B2:"=A1", the B2 cell will fill
	with "!Circular Reference" to let you know.

I hope you enjoy using VelaBorja's Spreadsheet!
